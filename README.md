## 🧠 About this project

> “Man doesn't choose to evolve — evolution arrives, and we must find her.”

Mexico is a growing country. Its companies are growing too — some of them faster than they can adapt. And sometimes, in that rush, they forget basic digital hygiene. For example, using WhatsApp for critical communication without two-step verification is already a vulnerability for a modern Mexican company.

From my background in mechanical work and physical security, I saw that people often protect their assets with firearms — like in the good old days. But no gun can defend against cyberattacks. Even security companies, like the one I used to work for, had hidden digital vulnerabilities.

As I began my journey in cybersecurity, I asked for permission to apply some basic security measures (listed in this repository). My intention was to protect the company and, at the same time, learn how to apply real-world security strategies.

This repository contains the risk assessments, reports, and visualizations I created based on public datasets and best practices. It is built entirely for educational and professional purposes — and does not include any private or sensitive data.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Simulate a cybersecurity audit using real-world standards and open data.
- Apply risk management techniques to legacy-style infrastructure.
- Practice blue team methodologies: detection, prevention, reporting.
- Create professional-grade documentation for interview and portfolio use.

## 🛠 Tools & Methodologies

- MITRE ATT&CK Framework
- NIST NVD CVE Feeds
- CICIDS 2017 Intrusion Detection Dataset
- Sysmon and Windows logs (SwiftOnSecurity config)
- Python for data parsing and log generation
- Excel for risk register and cartography
- Markdown and PDF export for reporting

  ## 🔎 Risk Register
